# Lotto
An application which asks the end user for a set of lotto numbers, and then calculates how many lifetimes it would take to win the lotto with.

This project was created to advance my own skills and it was the very first time I did anything with packages. It contains simple methods for dealing with randomized integers, a few Array methods (such as sorting, matches between arrays etc.) and a console input method, which does automatic troubleshooting if the input is not an integer.

Time this project took: about 20ish hours.

Code Style - Standard (I think)

Built with VS Code
